                                    🐕 DOG BREED CLASSIFICATION WITH DEEP LEARNING

✅ I developed an application that classifies each dog picture in its category and gives the percentage of confidence. 

✅ I used several Deep Learning models such as : VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2 and YOLO11 which is the best in terms of performance & speed.
